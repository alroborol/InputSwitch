## Why People Need InputSwitch

### Real User Pain Points
- "Switching input methods on macOS is slow and requires too many clicks or keyboard shortcuts that are hard to remember."
- "macOS sometimes forgets my preferred input method per app or window."
- "On macOS, the Home and End keys go to the top/bottom of the document, not the start/end of the line like on Windows/Linux."
- "I constantly have to use Cmd+Arrow instead, which is less convenient."
- "There’s no easy way to remap these keys system-wide."
- "I work in multiple languages and wish macOS could automatically switch input methods based on what I’m typing."
- "Third-party tools for remapping or switching are often buggy, not maintained, or require complex configuration."
