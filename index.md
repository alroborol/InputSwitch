      ### Real User Pain Points
      - Switching input methods on macOS is slow and requires too many clicks or keyboard shortcuts that are hard to remember.
      - macOS sometimes forgets my preferred input method per app or window.
      - On macOS, the Home and End keys go to the top/bottom of the document, not the start/end of the line like on Windows/Linux.
      - I constantly have to use Cmd+Arrow instead, which is less convenient.
      - There’s no easy way to remap these keys system-wide.
      - I work in multiple languages and wish macOS could automatically switch input methods based on what I’m typing.
      - Third-party tools for remapping or switching are often buggy, not maintained, or require complex configuration.
